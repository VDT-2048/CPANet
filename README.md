# FSSD-12 dataset
We integrate a novel few-shot segmentation dataset （FSSD-12）of pure strip steel surface defect, including 12 different surface defects of strip steel.

# CPANet
We propose a few-shot semantic segmentation method named cross position aggregation network (CPANet) to solve the number of strip steel surface defect is deficient and the ground truth is difficultly labeled.
